# 📊 Shield Insurance Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my internship with **AtliQ Technologies**, based on a real-world business case from **Shield Insurance**, a company operating in five major Indian cities. The goal was to build an insightful Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🧩 Project Objective

The pilot project aims to help Shield Insurance understand key metrics such as total customers, revenue, daily growth rates, sales mode performance, and customer segmentation by city and age group. These insights will help the company improve its strategy and operational efficiency.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI** for dashboard development  
- **Power Query** for data transformation  
- **DAX** for calculated metrics  
- **PowerPoint** for final presentation  
- Data visualization, segmentation, trend analysis

## 📈 Key Dashboard Features
