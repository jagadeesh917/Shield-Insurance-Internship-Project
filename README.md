# 📊 Shield Insurance Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my internship with **AtliQ Technologies**, based on a real-world business case from **Shield Insurance**, a company operating in five major Indian cities. The goal was to build an insightful Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🧩 Project Objective

- **Power Query** for data transformation

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

### 🎯 Focus on the 18–24 Age Group
- With only **1,916 customers**, this key demographic needs attention through low-cost, flexible plans and awareness campaigns across digital platforms.

### 📱 Accelerate Digital Adoption via Online App
- Leverage the **Online App sales growth (4.18% → 27.12%)** by improving app UX, offering exclusive discounts, and gamifying user engagement.

### 🤝 Reinvigorate Offline Agent Performance
- As **Offline Agent sales declined to 44.94%**, equip agents with hybrid tools, regular training, and local community initiatives to boost performance.

### 💡 Tap Into the 31–40 Age Segment Potential
- With the **largest customer base (10,562)**, introduce loyalty programs, upsell premium plans, and tailor communication to this segment’s financial goals.

### 📊 Optimize Product Strategy (P1 vs P8)
- Scale promotions around **Policy P1**, the top-seller, and reevaluate **Policy P8** for potential improvements or retirement due to low preference.

### 📆 Use Seasonal Campaigns in April & November
- Since growth slows during **April and November**, introduce timely promotions, bundled offers, and targeted campaigns in these months.

### 🌐 Improve Digital Platforms
- Enhance the app and website to ensure seamless navigation, personalized product discovery, and fast onboarding experiences.

### 🔄 Enable Seamless Online-Offline Integration
- Allow customers to **start purchases online and finish offline**, combining convenience with trust through unified workflows.

### 📍 Localized Campaigns for Underserved Cities
- Run influencer-driven awareness campaigns in mid-tier cities (e.g., Indore) where growth potential is high but currently underutilized.

### 🔄 Loyalty & Retention Strategy
- Implement **renewal reminders**, cashback offers, and **rewards programs** to improve long-term customer retention.

## 📌 Conclusion

Shield Insurance is on a strong growth trajectory. By focusing on the **18–24 age group**, **strengthening digital channels**, and **bridging the gap between online and offline experiences**, the company can scale customer acquisition and retention sustainably.
