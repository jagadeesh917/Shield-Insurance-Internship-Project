# 📊 Shield Insurance Internship Project

This project was developed as part of my internship with **AtliQ Technologies**, based on a real-world business case from **Shield Insurance**, a company operating in five major Indian cities. The goal was to build an insightful Power BI dashboard to support data-driven decision-making.
